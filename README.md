## Height Width Clone

by Andre

The purpose of the script example is for...<br>
I have wrapper that loads dynamic video feeds from a provider.<br>
But sometimes the video is larger then the wrapper or it's not taking up the full height and width leaving a gap of space.<br>
so to fix this issue if you know the id or class of the child-element you can force the child element to take up the full space of the wrapper
having a nice clean container.
